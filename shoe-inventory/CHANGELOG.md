## Logging Standards Established
- Every source file must include logging header comment
- All changes must be documented in CHANGELOG.md with detailed entries
- Log entries must include: timestamp, AI model, files modified, changes made, purpose, and testing
- Reference: See docs/ai-collaboration-guide.md for complete guidelines

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1: React + TypeScript frontend implementation
- Add logging headers to all source files during implementation
- Set up testing framework with Jest and React Testing Library
- Implement comprehensive logging throughout application
- Create unit tests for all components and services

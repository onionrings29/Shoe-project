# AI Collaboration & Logging Best Practices

## Source File Header Template
Every source code file MUST include this header comment:

```typescript
// LOGGING: All changes to this file must be documented in CHANGELOG.md using JSON format
// Include: timestamp, file path, change_type, summary, author, and diff if applicable
// Reference: See docs/logging-instructions.md for detailed JSON format guidelines
```

## Detailed Logging Requirements

### 1. Per-File Logging
**Each source file should contain:**
- Header comment with logging instructions (as above)
- JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Change history section at the bottom (optional but recommended)

### 2. Change Log Entries Must Use JSON Format:
- **Required Fields**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
  - `file`: Full path to the file that was changed
  - `change_type`: One of "creation", "modification", "deletion"
  - `summary`: Brief description of what was changed and why
  - `author`: Name of the AI or person making the change
- **Optional Fields**:
  - `diff`: Git-style diff output showing exact changes (recommended for modifications)
  - `testing`: Description of testing performed
  - `purpose`: Business or technical rationale for the change

### 3. Example JSON Change Entry
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T04:15:00Z",
  "file": "src/services/firestore.ts",
  "change_type": "modification",
  "summary": "Added shoeService with CRUD operations for Firestore integration",
  "diff": "@@ -1,3 +1,15 @@\n+ import { collection, addDoc, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';\n+ export class ShoeService {\n+   async getShoes() {\n+     const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'shoes'));\n+     return querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data());\n+   }\n+ }",
  "author": "AI: DeepSeek Reasoner",
  "testing": "Manual verification of Firestore connection and data retrieval",
  "purpose": "Create foundation for shoe data management in the inventory system"
}
```

## Is This Overkill?

**No, this is not overkill** for AI collaboration because:

1. **Traceability**: Essential for tracking changes across multiple AI sessions
2. **Accountability**: Clearly shows which AI made specific changes
3. **Maintainability**: Makes the codebase understandable to humans and AIs
4. **Quality Control**: Encourages thoughtful changes with documentation

**Balance is key**: The logging should be comprehensive but not verbose. Focus on meaningful changes rather than trivial edits.

## Will AIs Follow This?

**Most modern AIs will follow clear instructions** if they are:
- Prominently displayed in source files
- Reinforced in documentation
- Part of a consistent pattern across the codebase

**To ensure compliance**:
1. Include instructions in every file header
2. Maintain consistent logging format
3. Review and correct logging during code reviews
4. Use linters or pre-commit hooks if possible

## Best Practices for AI-Driven Development

### 1. Structured Logging
- Use consistent format across all changes
- Include both technical and business context
- Document decisions, not just code changes

### 2. Version Control Integration
- **Every major change must include a detailed git commit** with descriptive message
- Commit messages should reference CHANGELOG.md entries and include change summary
- Use branches for experimental changes and feature development
- Tag commits with AI model information for traceability
- Commit messages should follow conventional format: "feat: ", "fix: ", "docs: ", etc.

### 3. Code Quality Measures
- Include unit tests with all significant changes
- Maintain coding standards and style guides
- Document architecture decisions separately

### 4. AI Session Management
- Start each session by reviewing previous logs
- End each session with comprehensive logging
- Maintain session continuity through documentation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Add Headers to Existing Files
```bash
# Add logging headers to all source files
find src/ -name "*.ts" -exec sed -i '' '1i\
// LOGGING: All changes to this file must be documented in CHANGELOG.md using JSON format\
// Include: timestamp, file path, change_type, summary, author, and diff if applicable\
// Reference: See docs/logging-instructions.md for detailed JSON format guidelines\
' {} \;
```

### Phase 2: Create Logging Validation
- Add pre-commit hooks to check for logging compliance
- Create CI/CD checks for proper documentation
- Implement automated logging templates

### Phase 3: Maintain Discipline
- Regular audits of logging quality
- Continuous improvement of logging guidelines
- Adaptation based on what works best

## Tools and Automation Suggestions

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use Husky to validate logging before commits
2. **Templates**: Create snippet templates for common change types
3. **Linters**: Custom ESLint rules to enforce logging standards
4. **AI Prompts**: Include logging requirements in all AI instructions

This approach ensures that your project maintains high quality documentation throughout its lifecycle, making it easier for both AIs and humans to understand and contribute to the codebase.
